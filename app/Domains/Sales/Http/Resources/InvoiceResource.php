/**
 * An invoice as the admin API publishes it.
 *
 * The stored columns come first, then the derived reading aids: dates rendered
 * in the company's date format, the shareable PDF link, whether the document is
 * still editable and whether the payment module is switched on.
 *
 * Two different gating strategies live side by side here, and the difference is
 * intentional.
 *
 * The crediting and settlement blocks -- `credit_notes`, `credited_total`,
 * `credited_status`, `credited_quantities` and `payment_allocations` -- are
 * published only when the caller already eager-loaded the relation they read.
 * Probing those per row would cost extra queries on every line of a paginated
 * listing, so an index response simply omits them and the detail response,
 * which loads `creditNotes.items` and `allocations.payment`, carries them.
 *
 * The trailing associations -- lines, contact, author, taxes, custom field
 * values, company, currency -- instead probe the relation with an existence
 * query each time, so they are correct whether or not anything was eager
 * loaded. That is a query per association per row; it is the established shape
 * of this payload and is preserved deliberately.
