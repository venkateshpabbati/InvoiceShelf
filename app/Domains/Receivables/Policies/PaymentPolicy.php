/**
 * Who may work with payments.
 *
 * Every decision has two halves: the Bouncer ability, and -- for anything
 * aimed at an existing row -- membership of the company that row belongs to,
 * so an ability held in one company never reaches another company's data.
 *
 * Bouncer answers for the user it currently has scoped, not for the $user
 * handed in; that argument only feeds the membership half.
 *
 * Four distinct abilities govern the payment: viewing, creating, editing and
 * deleting, plus a fifth for mailing the receipt out. Restoring and erasing
 * ride on the delete ability. The bulk delete is checked against the class
 * rather than a row, since it is granted before the ids are known.
